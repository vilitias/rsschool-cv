3. Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
   Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
   learning new things from everywhere etc.).
4. Stack:
   - HTML
   - CSS
   - JavaScript
   - React
   - Git
   - REST api
5. Code examples (LATEST)
6. Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
   freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
   Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)
7. Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)
8. English level: C1
   I've been in love with the English language from early age, and now most of the media I consume is in English. I'd say I learned it mostly thanks to videogames and podcasts. I've been to a few countries and used the language to communicate with people during those trips.
